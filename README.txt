Simulation Types
-Uncorrelated- relies on 0% correlation. Effectively tosses a die for each seat in each individual simulation, and uses
that result to determine the winner of each seat
-Correlated- relies on 100% correlation. Tosses a die once per simulation and uses that to determine the results of all
seats within a simulation. Perhaps closer to a "wave" election.
